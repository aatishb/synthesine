category: filter
blurb: |
  `twoPointAverage()` creates a two point average filter.

  `.apply` returns a function that applies the filter equation and updates the filter state.

  Filter equation:
  ```
  output[i] = 0.5 * (input[i] + input[i - 1])
  ```

  In synthesine, filters are functions with methods for applying and setting the filter, and an internal memory that keeps track of the state of the filter. The technical term for the kind of object is a closure. Every time you create a filter, the state is erased, so it's a good idea to define your filters only once, in the setup function.

  You can find the code for the comb function in the [synthesine library](https://github.com/aatishb/synthesine/blob/master/libraries/dsp.js).

let combFilter;

function setup() {
  // create & store filter
  combFilter = comb(1, 10, 0, 0);
}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .map(combFilter.apply) // apply filter
    .mult(0.1);
}
